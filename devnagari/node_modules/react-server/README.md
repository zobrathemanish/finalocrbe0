React framework with server render for blazing fast page load and seamless
transitions between pages in the browser.

** **

## What is it?

React Server is an [Express](http://expressjs.com/) [middleware](http://expressjs.com/guide/using-middleware.html)
for serving universal (isomorphic) JavaScript applications built with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

Read more on [our dev blog](https://www.redfin.com/blog/tag/react-server).

## Getting started

The _easiest_ way to get started is with our [yeoman
generator](packages/generator-react-server):

```bash
# install yeoman
npm install -g yo

# install the react-server generator
npm install -g generator-react-server

# make a new react-server project in the CURRENT directory
yo react-server

# compile and run the new app
npm run compile
npm run start
# go to http://localhost:3000
```

That hooks you up with [`react-server-cli`](packages/react-server-cli), which
will take care of the _server_ part and get you up and running right away.

#### Why `react-server`?

One of the great things about React is its support for server-side rendering,
which can make sites show up faster for users and play better with search engine
bots.

However, when you actually try to use React for server-side rendering, you
quickly run into a bunch of practical problems, such as:

- How should I load data on the server for my components?
- How do I ensure that the client and the server load the same data and generate
the same HTML markup?
- How do I write code that can be both generated server-side and be part of a
single-page application (SPA)?
- How should I optimize the delivery of my JavaScript and CSS?
- How do I find out about and follow performance best practices?
- How do I ensure that my site is streamed to the browser as quickly as humanly
possible?
- How can I make my app resilient when my backend has high latency spikes?

`react-server` is a framework designed to make universal (n√©e isomorphic) React
easier to write, providing standard answers for these questions and more. When
you write your app for `react-server`, you concentrate on your React components,
and `react-server` takes care of everything else that's needed to run and deploy
real React server-rendered apps. Under the hood, `react-server` is doing a bunch
of clever optimizations, many borrowed from the ideas behind [Facebook's Big Pipe](https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/bigpipe-pipelining-web-pages-for-high-performance/389414033919/),
to make sure that your site shows up as quickly as humanly possible
for your users.
